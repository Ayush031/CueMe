# CueMe
Remote Music Queue Management

## Use Case
Imagine you're at a party, and you'd like to hear your favorite song, but you're limited to a single device to control the music. With our web service, you no longer need to be tied to that device. You can easily add songs to the music queue remotely, giving you the freedom to curate the playlist from anywhere.
